## Finishing Up the Soldering

### Connecting the Rows

I attached the rows first. I pretty much just pulled each wire to where it need to be, cut it to length, and stripped ~0.5" off of the end.

Then I wrapped it in a loop around the joint and soldered.

### Connecting the Columns

Then I did the exact same thing for the columns.

First 6 columns:

Then the rest:

![All Columns][all columns]

Holy shit I'm finally done soldering:

### Keycaps and Firmware

Finally I put keycaps on and set up some initial firmware.
