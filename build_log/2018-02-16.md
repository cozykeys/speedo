## Creating the Thumb Clusters
I started off by copying a single switch cutout and rotating it back 10 degrees
so it would be horizontal:

I wanted to visualize what the keycaps would look like to get a better idea of
how to position the keys. PimpMyKeyboard provides PDF spec sheets for their
keycaps so I got the dimensions for a DCS 1u keycap from that and rounded to
18.1mm:

Using those dimensions, I added the keycap overlay:

I figured the best way to get a nice arc shape for the thumb keys was to lay them out on a circle. I had to brush up on some trigonometry to remember how to get the coordinates of points on a circle:

One slight annoyance in Inkscape (Or SVG files in general?) is that the X,Y coordinates of an object are not based on the object's center but on the bottom left most point:

Also, when an object is rotated, height and width changes as well:

These aren't a big deal we can easily get the adjusted values with a few simple equations:

The last step was finding a suitable value for *r*. I could have done some more math and come up with a radius based on the distance between the closest corners of each keycap; however, that seemed like more work than doing a little bit of trial and error.

So, I started with a radius of 50mm. That was too small so I bumped it up to 100mm, which was too big. From there I basically just did a manual binary search until I came to the value of 82 which seemed to suffice.

I decided to start at an angle of 10 degrees -- which is the angle the keys are already at on the Atreus62 -- and bump it up by 15 degrees for each additional key.

The final product:

After that I just had to paste the thumb clust back on the original board. I lined up the first key using the same spacing that the existing keys on the board used and then redesigned the bottom of the case to accomodate the additional real estate.

I ordered the first revision from Ponoko so I will see if it is comfortable and if I think anything should be changed.
