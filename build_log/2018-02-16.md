## Creating the Thumb Clusters
I started off by copying a single switch cutout and rotating it back 10 degrees
so it would be horizontal:

![Switch Cutout][switch cutout]

I wanted to visualize what the keycaps would look like to get a better idea of
how to position the keys. PimpMyKeyboard provides PDF spec sheets for their
keycaps so I got the dimensions for a DCS 1u keycap from that and rounded to
18.1mm:

![Keycap Dimensions][keycap dimensions]

Using those dimensions, I added the keycap overlay:

![Keycap Overlay][keycap overlay]
