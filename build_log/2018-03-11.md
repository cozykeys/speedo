## Rows and Columns

### Rows 

With all the diodes done, I started on the rows. I roughly measured the distance between switches and then stripped the wire in segments.

Then, following the advice in the guide, I looped each diode pin around the stripped section of wire and soldered the joint.

Rinse repeat:

![Three Rows][three rows]

And again...

![Four Rows][four rows]

Ah, finally.

![Five Rows][five rows]

### Columns

With the rows done, I started on the columns. Again, I roughly measured the distance between the switches vertically and then stripped them accordingly.

I created the first loop on one end and soldered that to the top switch in the column. Then, I would move the sleeve close to the joint, wrap a new loop around the pin on the next switch and solder that joint. Repeat this a few more times and the column is done.

I only made it through 3 columns before deciding to call it a day. Making the loops for both the rows and columns is an ultra-tedious pain in the ass.
