## Getting the Controller Ready

### Attaching the Wires

To avoid making the same mistake again, I decided the attach the wires to the contoller first this time.

I cut wires plenty long to reach each row/column switch, stripped one end, looped it, and then solder to the backside of the controller.

I forgot to take pictures during this process, but this is the end result:

Soldering on the bottom side of the chip let me worry less about other electrical components in close proximity to the solder joints.

### Placing the Controller

With all the wires attached, I used flush cutters to clean up the solder joints and then hot glued the chip to the plate to keep it in place.
