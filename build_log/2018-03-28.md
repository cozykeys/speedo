## Destroying a Teensy 3.2

### The First Few Columns

The final step of attaching the controller was upon me so I started wiring up the columns. I was soldering them to the switches first and then to the PCB:

### The Accident

I have something called benign essential tremor which causes my hands to be a bit shaky. Normally it isn't problematic but today it was.

I couldn't keep my hand steady enough and I accidentally got solder on the pins of the processing unit on my Teensy 3.2.

Trying to use a solder sucker to clean it up didn't help and I ended up just spreading it around even more.

So, I scrapped the chip, desoldered the few switch joints I'd completed, and ordered a Teensy 2.0.

On the bright side, the Teensy 3.2 requires setting up ChibiOS to use QMK and there's not much documentation for doing that. At least the 2.0 should make the firmware setup process easier.
