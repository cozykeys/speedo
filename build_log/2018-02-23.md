## Rev1 Comes to an End

Yesterday the first iteration of the case files came from Ponoko. I'm glad I
chose Ponoko because it was the cheapest option and I made a couple of
mistakes.

They were out of the material that I ordered which was a light blue matte
acrylic so they used the clear blue gloss acrylic instead. Some pictures of the
plates:

## Oops

The critical mistake that I made is the the second innermost thumb key is too
close to the key just above it. I thought I left enough space for the keycaps
to fit but I guess not.

It's more obvious in this picture I took in front of my monitor:

## Solution

Anyways, after a bit of comparing the Atreus62 keys to the Speedo, I've decided
to put the two innermost thumb keys back to their original location. Pulling
the innermost key further down is actually less comfortable and the angle on
the second innermost thumb key is unnecessary.

That said, the two outer thumb keys are incredibly comfortable so I will be
leaving those exactly as is. That's actually a bit of a relief because the
perimeter of the case doesn't have to change now.

## Next Steps

So, the next step will be moving those two thumb keys back and then designing
the middle layers. I'm thinking I might make two different middle layers:
* A "top" middle layer with an area for the controller to sit
* A "bottom" middle layer that only runs the perimeter of the case

Since I don't have a PCB, the controller is just going to be hot glued to the
case. Adding a plastic area for it to fit snuggly in should help avoid any
issues when plugging/unplugging the USB cable. The downside is that a
translucent switch plate is out of the question because the hot glue will be
ugly to look at.

The alternative is to use a breakout board, something like this:

Unfortunately that is big and a goal for this board is to keep it as low
profile as possible.

I'm hoping to get rev2 done tomorrow and ordered by Monday! I currently have a
Kailh low profile switch tester and 70 low profile keycaps in the mail. I'm
hoping to decide which switch I plan to use so I can get the rest of the parts
I need ordered ASAP.
