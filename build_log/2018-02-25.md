## Order is in for Rev2

So this evening I finally got around to making the adjustments that I wanted in
revision 2.

I actually decided on one more significant change which was to add 4 additional
keys in the center of the board to reduce the wasted space. I plan to use these
as media keys (Volume up/down, play/pause, and next track) but I could see how
some folks might like having dedicated arrow keys. They also provide a decent
spot to showcase artisans for those who are into that sort of thing.

This time I did a better job at using keycap overlays to ensure that all of the
keys would fit:

*I took that screenshot before I fixed the alignment so the final version is
actually centered correctly.*

Other than that, none of the changes are all that interesting so I'm not going
to go into the process here. The changes included:
* Move the two inner thumb keys back to their original spots
* Add more screwholes to the board to make it feel less flimsy
* Change the screwholes to fit M2 better because I have a lot of extra M2
  screws and standoffs lying around from Iris builds
* Add etching around where the Teensy should sit
* Add Speedo logo etching on the back

The final product:

I'm hoping that this one feels good enough to settle on. Ideally I will use
this opportunity to learn a little more about PCB design and try to design a
PCB once I'm happy with the layout.
