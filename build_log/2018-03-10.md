## Starting the Build

### Inserting the Switches

First step was putting the switches into the plate:

![Switches Inserted (Top)][switches inserted top]

![Switches Inserted (Bottom)][switches inserted bottom]

### Gluing the Switches in Place

Next was to hot glue the switches in place. Because the switches wouldn't be PCB mounted, this is necessary to keep them aligned and in place:

![Switches Glued (Top)][switches glued top]

![Switches Glued (Bottom)][switches glued bottom]

### Soldering the Diodes

For the soldering process, I roughly followed the advice from this guide on GeekHack:

[A modern handwiring guide](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87689.0)

So, first thing I did was create little loops in each diode and place them on the switch pins.

![Diode Loop][diode loop]

![Diodes Placed][diodes placed]

And then I soldered them.

![Diodes Soldered][diodes soldered]

I ended the day with all of the diodes soldered but didn't want to get started on the rows yet.
