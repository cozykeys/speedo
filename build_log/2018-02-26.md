## Deciding on Parts

Now that the second revision of the case file has been ordered from Ponoko, I
need to decide what parts I'm going to use for the first build.

### The Decision

* Switches: Kailh low-profile reds
* Keycaps: Blank low-profile white keycaps

I bought a low-profile switch tester set from NovelKeys and tried out all of
the switches. In terms of feel, the jades actually feel heavenly but they are
also incredibly loud and I would feel guilty using them in the presence of
others.

These days I generally like linear switches but the low-profile mixed with
linear actually doesn't feel great. I would go with browns instead but they are
out of stock on NovelKeys so it looks like I'll just suck it up and use reds.

One shitty thing about going with low-profile switches is that only one store
sells compatible keycaps and the quality leaves much to be desired. I ordered
70 of them and many of them have blemishes as shown in this picture:

### A Close Second

There is currently a group buy in progress for some keycaps that look really
nice. The base kit is Â£61.50 which is $85.81 at the time of writing this. It
has the exact amount of 1u keys necessary to fill the keyboard and would look
like:

I've heard very good things about all of the Devlin keycaps which is what is
what tempted me the most to go this route. I also already have plenty of normal
switches so I wouldn't need to order any.

I'll probably end up getting these keycaps anyways and using them in a future build.
